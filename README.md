Project developed during the 14th week at <Academia de Código_> #49 Bootcamp Aveiro.

Project description
Our third group project which took part in our 14th week at <Academia de Código_> #49 Bootcamp @Aveiro. Also known as the hackaton project.

The idea
We received a challenge to make a program that is somehow connected to the theme "Wizard of Oz, somewhere over the rainbow". After a brainstorm, we agreed to make a game about Dorothy's life, influenced by drugs and all the domestic violence that can be found in the present reality. She basically tries to escape the sad reality, consuming some hallucinogenic mushrooms. If she consumes too many, she can OD, if she doesn't consume any at all, she becomes depressed and also dies.

The Development
At the start we split the group in two, one to work on the story, and the other to start coding. After facing some problems with libraty configurations we decided to keep doing the game, since the story was already complete. Using Kanban methodology, we reunited evey 2 hours, to check progress and decide what to be done.

My Role
I helped decide the time between sprints, and what we should do.
Regarding coding, I was working on the backend, working on game logic and game cycle, also helped on the image editing (menu and characters). 

Tech && Methodologies
Java 7, IntelliJ, MVC, OOP, Git, SimpleGFX, Inkscape, Photoshop, Adobe After Effects.
